üìù **Step-by-Step Guide: Setting up Master-Slave Architecture in Jenkins**

To set up a Master-Slave architecture in Jenkins, follow the steps below:

**On the Jenkins Master:**

1. Access the Jenkins UI:
   - Open a web browser and enter the URL of your Jenkins master.
   - Log in with appropriate credentials.

2. Configure Node Settings:
   - Click on **Manage Jenkins** in the left-hand sidebar.
   - Select **Manage Nodes and Clouds**.
   - Click on the **New Node** button to create a new node.

3. Configure the Slave Node:
   - Enter a **Name** for the slave node (e.g., `slave-node01`).
   - Provide a **Description** for the slave node.
   - Set the **Number of executors** to the desired value (e.g., `1`).
   - Specify the **Remote root directory** on the slave node (e.g., `/opt`).
   - Enter any relevant **Labels** for the slave node (e.g., `slave01`).
   - Choose the appropriate **Usage** option based on your requirements.
   - Select the **Launch method** as "Launch agent by connecting it to the controller."
   - Customize any other settings as needed.

4. Save the Slave Node Configuration:
   - Click on **Save** to save the configuration changes.

**On the Slave Node:**

5. Connect to the Slave Node:
   - Connect to the slave node using SSH or any other preferred method.

6. Install Java Runtime Environment (JRE):
   - Run the following command to install Java OpenJDK 11:
     ```
     sudo amazon-linux-extras install java-openjdk11 -y
     ```

7. Download the Jenkins Agent JAR File:
   - Change to the desired directory (e.g., `/opt`):
     ```
     cd /opt/
     ```
   - Download the Jenkins agent JAR file:
     ```
     curl -sO [JENKINS_MASTER_URL]/jnlpJars/agent.jar
     ```
     Replace `[JENKINS_MASTER_URL]` with the actual URL of your Jenkins master.

8. Launch the Jenkins Agent:
   - Run the following command to launch the Jenkins agent and connect it to the master:
     ```
     java -jar agent.jar -jnlpUrl [AGENT_JNLP_URL] -secret [AGENT_SECRET] -workDir "/opt"
     ```
     Replace `[AGENT_JNLP_URL]` with the URL of the agent's JNLP file provided by Jenkins.
     Replace `[AGENT_SECRET]` with the secret token for the agent obtained from Jenkins.

9. Wait for the Agent to Connect:
   - The Jenkins agent will establish a connection with the master.
   - Once connected, the agent will appear as online in the Jenkins UI.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up a Master-Slave architecture in Jenkins. The slave node is now connected to the Jenkins master, and you can utilize it for distributed builds and other tasks.
